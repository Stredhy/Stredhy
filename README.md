# Hi There ![hand.gif](gifs/hand.gif)

##### Welcome to my GitHub ![github-icon.gif](gifs/github-icon.gif)

</center>

I'm an amateur programming developer that really love coding in free time, research, and study just to spend time and learn as much as I am able to.
Nowadays, I'm coursing a bachelor in informatics engineering and learning to code from books and documentation about the language I use and the tools that I need, not only with the school. 
It should be noted that I am not an expert, but I try to improve every day.

Here I have some projects I've worked on, some of them are private and you can only check those projects that are public.

If you have any suggestions, you can just contact me clicking on any of these links:
